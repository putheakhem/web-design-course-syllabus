This `HTML` tutorial helps you master `HTML`. Mastering HTML and its many elements is critical for any type of web professional. `HTML` or `"HyperText Markup Language"` describes the basic structure and content of a web page.

## [CSS](CSS.md)

`CSS` (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language that describes the presentation of web pages. Whereas `HTML` is what forms the structure of a web page, `CSS` is what we use to style the `HTML` with colors, backgrounds, font sizes, layout, and more. As you'll soon learn, `CSS` is one of the core technologies for designing and building websites.
